## Where to find more help


- One of the best sources of information about Dash is in the official Plotly [Dash Tutorial][dash-tutorial]
and documentation.  It's continually being updated as new features are added to Dash and Plotly.  It also has lots of great examples.  

- Check out the  [Dash Community Forum](https://community.plotly.com/). You will probably find an answer in one of the posts,
but if not, try posting a question.

-  Here is a guide on [how to get your questions answered on the forum][forum-questions].

- Subscribe to  [video tutorials by Charming Data][charming-data]
created by Dash community member Adam Schroeder  


- Don't miss this [Awesome Dash](https://github.com/ucg8j/awesome-dash) GitHub repo.  It's a curated list of Dash and Plotly resources
