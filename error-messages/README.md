# Error Messages:  What they really mean -- and how to fix them

[Here is a great post](https://community.plotly.com/t/solved-dash-layout-not-working-as-expected-general-debugging-tips/4724/4?u=annmariew)
 on the forum about debugging by Chris Parmer, the creator of Dash.  This is from 2017, so some of the information is dated. 
 For example the [Dev tools](https://dash.plotly.com/devtools) have many new features now.  Still, the post has lots of
 helpful debugging tips that still apply.
