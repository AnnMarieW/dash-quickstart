- One of the best source of information about Dash is in the official Plotly [Dash Tutorial](https://dash.plotly.com/installation).
It's continually being updated as new features are added to Dash and Plotly.  It also has lots of great examples.  

- Check out the  [Dash Community Forum](https://community.plotly.com/). You will probably find an answer in one of the posts,
but if not, try posting a question.

-  Here is a guide on [how to get your questions answered on the forum](https://community.plotly.com/t/how-to-get-your-questions-answered-on-the-plotly-forum/40551).
