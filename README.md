# Dash Quickstart

This purpose of this repo is to help you get started with Dash and to make  high quality apps faster.

It will eventually be turned into an app, but in the meantime, I hope you find it a helpful resource.  (I use it
when I'm coding)

This is a work in progress.  If you have comments or suggestions, please feel free to [start a new issue](https://github.com/AnnMarieW/dash-quickstart/issues/new) 
or do a pull request. I'd be delighted to hear from you!
